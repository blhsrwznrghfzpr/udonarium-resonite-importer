# Object Conversion Specifications

This directory contains per-object conversion specifications from Udonarium to Resonite.

[日本語版](README.ja.md)

## Current Specs

- `terrain.md`: Terrain conversion rules and component structure
- `table-mask.md`: Table-mask conversion rules and component/material behavior

## Planned Specs

- `character.md`
- `card.md`
- `card-stack.md`
- `table.md`
- `text-note.md`

Each spec should document:

1. Source properties (Udonarium)
2. Target representation (Resonite slots/components)
3. Coordinate and rotation rules
4. Texture/material rules
5. Collider rules
6. Conditional behavior
7. Known constraints and test points
